# Note-Taker App

## Description

The movtivation was to create note-taking system that can be of use for the user.

I build this project to understand the way that express is used in node.js and javascript.

It solves the problem for users to take notes and modify any changes.

I learnt that there is a system to use express to recieve and send data through a server.
